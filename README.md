# Machine Learning Research - Tutorials
A set of colab-notebook based projects related to the machine learning.
 1. **ABM_Simulation.ipynb** is a Agent-Based Model application, we build a simulation framework with Monte Carlo method to study the potential disease spread if there is no control.
 2. **LinearRegression.ipynb** compares several different linear regression packages in Python.
 3. **LogisticRegression.ipynb** compares several different logistic regression packages in Python.
 4. **run_sparklyR.ipynb** demonstrates how to programm in R/sparklyr in a colab notebook.
 5. **EDA_JH_COVID19.ipynb** demonstrates how to pull data from JH COVID-19 datasets and do basic data transform and analysis. 
 
 
## COVID-19 related data, which can be perfect research topics for AI/Machine Learning purpose
 1. The dataset from Johns Hopkins University (dataset updated daily around midnight) (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data) provides realtime information and counts cases of COVID-19 coronavirus in China, as well as around the world, including numbers of deaths, recovered patients, and countries affected. The Hopkins team synthesizes data from WHO and four additional sources: CDC, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, China's National Health Commission, and ncov.dxy.cn, an independent data source maintained by Chinese physicians.

 2. COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) (dataset updated weekly) (https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) is sponsored by the White House and a coalition of leading research groups. As Mar 23, 2020, this dataset contains 44,000 scholarly articles. Each article is represented by a complex json file. Definitely NLP (natural Language process) is needed to study these data.
