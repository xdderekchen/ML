# Machine Learning Research
A set of colab-notebook based projects related to the machine learning.

1. **ABM_Simulation.ipynb** is a Agent-Based Model application, we build a simulation framework with Monte Carlo method to study the potential disease spread if there is no control.

2. **LinearRegression.ipynb** compares the different linear regression packages in Python.

2. **LogisticRegression.ipynb** compares the different logistic regression packages in Python.
