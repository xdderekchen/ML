# Machine Learning Research
A set of colab-notebook based projects related to the machine learning.
 1. **ABM_Simulation.ipynb** is a Agent-Based Model application, we build a simulation framework with Monte Carlo method to study the potential disease spread if there is no control.
 2. **LinearRegression.ipynb** compares several different linear regression packages in Python.
 3. **LogisticRegression.ipynb** compares several different logistic regression packages in Python.
 4. **run_sparklyR.ipynb** demonstrates how to programm in R/sparklyr in a colab notebook.
 5. **EDA_JH_COVID19.ipynb"" demonstrates how to pull data from JH COVID-19 datasets and do basic data transform and analysis.
